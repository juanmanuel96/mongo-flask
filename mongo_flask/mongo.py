        # MongoFlask
        Connect a Flask application to your MongoDB client. The MongoFlask object 
        has 3 attributes: client, db, and collections. 
        1. `client` is the MongoDB instance in the computer.
        2. `db` is the Database to connect to.
        3. `collections` is a dictrionary of all the collections in the database. 
        
        To use the functions of a collection it may be done as so:
        ```python
        current_app.mongo.collections['collection'].insert_one(insert)
        ```
        or
        ```python
        mongo.collections['collection'].insert_one(insert)
        ```
